 * @brief Header file for the Arena (aka Linear) Allocator.
 *
 * This module provides a simple linear memory arena implementation that allows
 * efficient memory allocation and deallocation without frequent calls to malloc
 * and free. The arena allocates memory in large chunks, and allocations are done
 * sequentially, which makes deallocation faster and easier by simply resetting
 * the arena. The arena supports reallocating and checkpoints for memory management.
